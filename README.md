# DeckFire.net
A site for creating and managing Magic decks, libraries, and proxies. Powered by Django, using latest Bootstrap and Angular, deployed on Heroku.

## Goals
I've enjoyed making use of other sites like TappedOut and Deckbox.org for a lot of things related to Magic, but so much of the experience of other Magic sites is tied to the aftermarket, shopping, trading, wishlisting, and so on. I would like to get away from those influences and create something focused squarely on the cards one owns and plays with.

**Magic: The Gathering** is a hobby for me, nothing more. I don't play for tournaments, I usually don't attend Friday Night Magic events, and release events don't really interest me. I'm in for the enjoyment of the game, especially with friends. I like interesting plays more than efficient ones, whacky interactions more than solitaire "I win" decks, and alternative game modes like multiplayer Commander (formerly? known as EDH/Elder Dragon Highlander).

To those ends, I want to create a site that provides good info about the existing game and interesting tools to help one manage their experience with it, without getting bogged down in the market values of cards.

Finally, though I do enjoy Magic, I am not an expert by any means, especially when it comes to deck building. I figure working on a site like this could help me gain a better understanding of the game proper, learning more about it as I go along.
